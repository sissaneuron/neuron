# Lesson 4: Tutti al ciclotrone.
### Yuppy ya ye

Syncrociclotrocoso: basic lecture and then introduction to instruments.

This is the only italian syncrothron facility.
Many labs use produced X-rays
The speaker lab is AFM for liquid and nanostructures.

## AFM part2

AFM is complementary to electron microscopy, which is performed here with high energy rays.


AFM gives information on deepness of structure, having info on the vertical dimension in the scale of nm.

- The resolution in z-axis depend on the interaction force, the distance you have with the tip from the sample.

- The resolution on xy is limited from tip size. Typical size is order of nanom.

*the point with AFM you don't need to build an enormous machine*

The best picture catched untill now refer to lattice structures, which allow for ensemble averaged error correction. classical lattice are memebrane protein, like ion channel --> nice pics!.
Even DNA with interacting proteins are visible. Still it requires a statistical analysis.

### Challanges in biology
* Biological structures in native state
Mechanobiology
Hig resolution < nm
dynamics
complementary to EM

#### Pro:
* High resolution possible
* Multi environmentReal living cells
* Not destructive
* Don't require labeling
* Information on interaction dynamics

####  Cons:
* Only surface is showed
* more complex than standard optics
* slow on corrugated sample
* No multiscale resolution
* You need a surface to lay down your molecule and immobilize it.
* Gentle pinning is required in order to not modify the sample

####Other:
* Time: High speed for dynamics to slow with high resolution
*  Other tecniques can be implemented simoultaneously
### Which forces:

1. long range **Coloumb** interaction.

2. if molecule has polarized **dipole-dipole interaction**

3. Electric field can lead to **induction**

4. **dispersion** force: polarization of close atoms and Van der Waals forces.
5. **Couloumb** repulsive forces, Pauli principle.

All this lead to Lennard Jones potential:

*slide with forces potential*

The image is obtained through the amplification of cantiliver and laser pointing.
The deflection detection is a crucial step. many methods have been used but the *position sensity detection*, which is the first introduced from Cavendish.
**The good recipe:**
Small cantiliver, focused laser, good position detector (CCD)

### Contact mode:

As you can see from the the graph the derivative of the potential offer an higher resolution in the repulsive regime than the attractive.

There are two ideal approach:

- keep distance fixed and measure the repulsive force.

- keep constant force and moving the tip up and down, *nice video in slide*, what you are measuring is the voltage applied to the piezoelectric needed to keep the force constant.
The piezoelectric resolution is about $nm$
The force is measured with cantiliver deformation.

##### why force is changing?
it's no obviously that the force changes is due to a topography change, even a different chemistry can happen which will variate the nature of Van der Waals force.
The frictional image will give you information on this, since the friction variation due to different chemistry and changing topography can easily be detected.

The basic answer is:
you need to combine different imaging tecniques to be sure of what is happening in your system.


##### On tip shape:

The triangular shape is needed to avoid the break of the tip itself when is moving on 'complex' surfaces, some carbon tips can be used, which are kind of thiner but more expensive and fragile.

### Dynamic mode:

Since the contact can damage the sample we can keep in the attractive range enancing the resolution through cantiliver oscillation

*Best resolution with less damaging of the system*

### Real instruments:

they are really sensible, and require an isolated room and an optical table.
Furthermore more compact (little and heavy) they are, less are sensible to noise.
Furthermore a long optical path it's not directly encreasing the resolution due to laser beam disaligning.
Size: cantiliver goes to 1 micron and the laser is focused on the limit of diffraction (nanometers).

*Explanantion how to setup the experiment respect to cantiliver allineation*

### Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy

It belongs to Scanning probe microscopy class, as Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy STM.
[short explanation of STM]
In this case the resolution is related only to the last atom

But **STM** applies to conductive materials only.

# Lesson5: AFM part3

### Afm approach curve  
![approach](/assets/approach.jpg)
In case there is a layer of water, it's everywhere and create a meniscus which affect the force required to approach and to detach from the sample.
So the measure can be performed only once the meniscus have been passed, we can see that the approach curve will be modified in case of water, see slide.

A soft cantiliver will suffer thermal oscillations.

### Hertz model:

- Infinitly thick sample
- sample isotropic and elastic
- sample is undeformable
- no other interaction
$$x=\frac{F}{k}$$

Through the Hertz model we can measure the Young modulus of the surfate through the measure of the force.
His showing how to relate the force to the sample height.

### Layered structures

The presence of many layers in cells structure affect the measure and this impact on the approach curve.

### AFM to investigate protein folding

The tips can be used to pull protein chain and study the folding mechanism, doing something really wow of statistical mechanic.

### Same how we can pull cells.
Cell capture with adhesive cantilever. We can measure the elastic ocoefficient of the nanoskeleton, the bond rupture energy, or sometime the microtubule elongation rate. So we can study the formation of theters, which is microtubule stretching.

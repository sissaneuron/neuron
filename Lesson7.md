Neuroscience is historically one of the most linked with the ability of performing new easurement.
Monitoring electricity activity is related to the tech behind it

### Nanotech for neuroscience

Nanotech is the ability to work on atomic scale, since everything has properties at the nanoscale.

The ability to create material which can transform the biological system with syntetic material which intarct with it.

The basic science is interested in perform new measures.
The other point of view is medical, the ability od transoport material inside the body: drug delivery, diagnostic tools and rigenerative medicine.
This research area has been largely founded from EU...

#### Nanotech for in vitro Neuroscience:

Recover and register neuronal elec activity: electric potential and synaptic activity.
The most famous way is single cell *patch clamp*, but other methods are available,

- local field potential
- MEG
- Elettro encefalo gramma
- ... larger scale.

We aim to measure a large scale network of neurons with he details of the subtreshold post synaptic potential (neuron which doesn' fire)
Some people related the non spike activity to the dark matter

To have this info in vivo is even more difficult, since the body continuosly move.

**nanotech could be able to deliver and detect stimulus**
even the ability of read voulountary activity and interface it with an external tecnological device

Nowadays a great development is flexible and more tolerated electronic;
*some photos on flexible and injectable electronic*
Apply this measures into invivo and free animals is necessary, all the rest are artifacts.

#### Regenerative medicine

Inject a particle which are not toxic and then deliver light which is much easier.


### What happens when we create hybrid?

Gaia Vallerini studies the interaction between nanodevice and bio.

#### Carbon Nano Tubes

We start from 2 nanoscale material, single and multi worm, two microtubes  single or multilayers CarboNanoTubes(CNT)
are really usefull to interface neurons they can be functionalizzed to constraint the electricity or growth of neurons, even more they are conductive.
They were proposed as an ideal material for neuron implants.

May neuron change theur behave?
The effect of this CNT will be enough to eneance regeneration

The experiments was on culture:
1. isolated and plate glass
2. cnt substrate
in 400/100 nm there is a tight junction between the cnt and the membrane, they are pinching into the membrane as trans mem protein.
do neurons die for this? no, but they improve their synaptic activity.
the main effects of nanotube was to improve the synaptic formation, still with non epilectic activity.
Also the action potential was measured, first experiments showed they were pretty similiar between control and CNT, then backward action potential was studied
BWAP is the electrical signal returning to neuite from axon, it affects spike time dependent plasticity, making easier to receive a synaptic signal and potentianting the efficence of synapse.
This can be measured in current clamp looking for the post spike potential area, it looks like the CNT improve the  BWAP: maybe the cnt are shortcutting the dendrites.
A recent experiment with semi conductive and metallic CNT showed the this effect is due to conductive ability.

In vitro the regeneration ability is encreased from the Nanotube.

**Second experiment; 3D CN sponges**


Another experiment is done on spinal neurons in multilayers, and the effect was really huge, many properties change in a non forecastable ways!
Many publication were done on this in 2000.



##### Voltage and current clamp

voltage: keep the voltage of the membrane constant and

##### Patch clamp:
needs some images, the pipette give a voltage to the liquid and collect the response current.
#### Nanotoxicty

### Multi electrode arrays

##Intro:
In 2008 with 1.2 bilions started the human brain project.

We need tools to measure large scale neuronal activity.

1. intracellular recordings with sharp or patch electrodes
2. Extracellular recs as MEA
3. Optogentics imaging and stimulation.
4. other larger scale methods.

Sharp electrode: very sharp electrode which will pimprick the cell and pentrate in it.

patch electrode: huge which is not entering the membrane but opening and creating a tight link

## MEA:
zooming out from a system of many complex elements looses resolution on the element.

*Is this possible to have single object resolution in large scale, again?*

The number of patch clamp sensor is limited by physical space constraints.

Mea allows for largelly attenuate and temporally filtered signals.
simoultaneous recording of large population without labeling.
electrode diameter is 100$um$
material is Silver Chloride which convert ionic current into electricity.

Mea is not recording the internal properties but the local field potential.
Which is not a clear signal:


#### Local Field potential
The LFP is blind to the subtreshold area of the neuron activity, an endogenus, EPSP or IPSP-released present the same lfp.`

How to correct and improve the quality of LFP singal? let's use nanotech!

Slide are self explained, will be attached.

The interesting variable in MEA construction is the coupling efficience and the frquency filter.

Recent approaches consist in changing the shape of the array sice the plate shape has a limited coupling efficiency.

Experiment with mushroom shapes gave really nice results with high coupling coeff and actin active caging of the electrode.
High frqs were not recorded anyway.

#### Carbon Nano Tubes on MEA:
The ability of detect subtreshold signal encreased of 100!

#### Recording with MEA

500 to 500 microns
with couple of microns resolution with 4-10 electrode for

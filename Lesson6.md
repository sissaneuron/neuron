# Lesson6 :
## Single object afm imaging

AFM is more and more used in biological community.
You can acquire very high resolution which are comparable or better to Optical tecnique in High resolution.

#### Cell imaging

*Commenting images, slide required*

#### EXOTHERA:
###### Afm and correlative imaging

*What can we do with afm and correlative tecniques?*
Vescicles are ensuring extracellular transport of molecules --> getting interesting to bio community: Vescicles for healing.

State of the art of vescicles is involving many fields but there is not a common definition and standard unit measure.
*What are exosomes?* ~ 100 nm
cels material outside cytoplasm $\sim 100 nm$

1. Do they differenti respect to origin?
2. How cells recognize exosom and internalize it, is this correlate with functionality of such cells?

##### Aim of the project:

* Collection standardization
* Analysis of biochemical and biophysical properties
* Therapy: in vivo test and final therapeutic use.

#### Biophysical characterization:
import slides.
Myka is a very good surface, a lattice of charged molecules which drip on the placed object.

##### Exosom and AFM
They need to be fixed or the afm will splash the center and we will see a donut.
A check of how much the measure is fine is the diamater and height dispersion histogram when measured on many cells.
The measure in liquid would be better, but in dry air is easier.

We can measure Young modulus from the slope of apllied force

##### Correlative information -> AFM-IR
Heat with IR at specific frequency just under the tip of AFM will let thermal fluctuations act on the tip and reveal which molecul is under the tip in that moment, since the IR can penetrate for 1 $\mu m$ the internal of vescicles can be revealed.


#### Absorbtion mechanism
There are a plenty of methods to absorb vescicles (fagocitosis)
the uptake of esosome is usually followed in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy.
